	<div class="post-content" style="margin-bottom:32px">
		With the focus on becoming a SuperApp of South East Asia, Grab needs to build sustainable relationship with our merchant-partners in the region. As part of a bigger project to <b>streamline the monetisation framework</b> for merchant, the business team came up with a new type of promotion which the customer would need to collect firstly in order to enjoy the discount later.

	<div class="callout1"></div>
	<div class=" fade callout1text">
		From now on we will call this new type <span style="font-family: avenir-heavy;">"Collectable voucher”</span>. The idea behind introducing this new promotion type is:</br>
		<p>
		1. By collecting the promotion, the customer indirectly shows his intention to visit the merchant.
		</p>
		<p>
		2. Uplifting revenue for the merchant by aligning consumer demand levers to merchant outcomes.
		</p>
		<p>
		3. Grab, as the platform, is helping merchant acquire new user. Hence Grab has the right to charge merchant for commission.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="header" style="margin-top: 60px">My Role</div>
	<div class="post-content">
		I was in charge of the end-to-end design process, everything from ideation, user research, animation, to hand-over. It was a small team so I worked closely with PMs and Engineers to deliver this product too. 
	</div>

	<div class="title" >Chapter I. The Problems</div>
	<div  class="header"> Problem Statement</div>
	<div class="post-content">This product will serve 2 main personas - the merchant and the customer. We want to build a sustainable trio relationship between merchant - customer - Grab. Merchants would want to fund the discount to promote their business while Grab will be the platform to reach customer.
		<p>
		For the merchant, the statement would be
		<span style="font-family: avenir-oblique">"As a merchant partnering with GrabPay, I want to promote my business and fund offers to acquire new customers from the Grab platform."</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		For customer in Singapore who uses GrabPay and needs to be incentivised in order to try new merchants, the statement would be 
		<span style="font-family: avenir-oblique">"As a customer, I want to discover and be incentivised to try out new merchants."</span>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div  class="header"> Business Objectives and Metrics</div>
	<div class="post-content">
			This project aims to be the lever to bring more revenue to the company. It provides a way for Grab to register a user's explicit interest in a merchant, thus allowing a commission charge to merchants for Grab-driven traffic.
		<p>
			We will be looking at revenue flows from commission as one of key business metric. This translates to, product wise, collection and utilisation of the collectable vouchers.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="title">Chapter II. The Research</div>
	<div class="post-content">We questioned ourselves on the value proposition of the new offer type. Although internally we know that if a user collects a voucher, he likely intends to go to the merchant and use it, however, will the collection action impact his psychology? Because Grab users never had to do an extra step to enjoy any promotion that made available for them in the app, what would be the sentiment now?
		To validate that the team is in the right direction, we had a quick check with a behavioural scientist.
	</div>
	<div  class="header"> A dash of behavioural science...</div>
	<div class="post-content">
		<span style="font-family: avenir-oblique">Endowment Effect </span> - In behavioural finance, endowment effect describes a circumstance in which an individual places a higher value on an object that they already own than the value they would place on that same object if they did not own it.</br>
		This brings the hypothesis: if the customer able to perceive the offer being "mine", then they will likely appreciate the value of the offer more than usual.
		<p>The question then would be,
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class=" fade callout" > <span style="display: flex; justify-content: center; ">"How might we make the user feel like the collectable offer is theirs?”</span></div>

	<div class="fade resize">
		<img src="/assets/images/c2c/c2c2.png" />
		</div>

	<div class="post-content">The answer may lie in the <span style="font-family: avenir-oblique;"> Smart Shopper Hypothesis </span> - Which is again another behavioural science statement. People get an ego-expressive kick from the feeling of doing an action to get a discount. These feelings can be enhanced by leading the user to feel responsible for the discount through taking actions such as collecting.
	</div> 

	<div  class="header"> How others do it</div>
	<div class="post-content">
		The concept of collecting a digital voucher is not new, hence has been well implicated in e-commerce and cash back reward platforms such as Lazada, Shopback  and Amazon
		<p>
		There usually be a way to nudge the customer toward collecting the voucher, be it scarcity or illusion of enhancement.

	<div  class="header"> Concept and Usability  Test</div>
	<div class="post-content">
		We were given 3 weeks to design from scratch, which was quite tight. However, me and my design partner Gwendolyn felt strongly in bringing the concept to test with Grab customer. Understand that collecting digital voucher is not necessarily entirely new to the South East Asian people but having it inside Grab platform, together with other existing product must be something worth checking. 
		<p>
		Like working under tight timeline wasn’t stressful enough, COVID-19 pandemic happened. In light of the unprecedented situation, we tried our best to conduct online interviews with 7 Grab customers from different user segments. It was challenging and yet interesting experience that the entire research process from planning, recruitment and execution were done remotely via phone call, video conference and email. It was more tedious compare to when we can talk face to face in the office, even internet and remote control didn’t want to cooperate. Regardless, it was worth to give the design a reality check. We came out of the 3 days test with a list of informative insights that bring much more confidence to our hand.

	<div class="title">Chapter III. The Design</div>
	<div  class="header"> To set a bit of context</div>
	<div class="post-content">
		• The feature is housed within an existing page called Neighbourhood Explore. Customers would be able to explore nearby merchants that are in partnership with Grab and able to pay with GrabPay when dine or shop at these stores.</br>
		• Seeing promotion/discount/deal/offer in Grab is nothing new, there are plenty of places around the app that user can encounter them in various forms. However, never before does the customer has to collect (or claim) the voucher in order to enjoy the discount. Hence the experience is relatively new to Grab user.</br>
		• Our job was to make sure the customer understands the new concept and able to utilise the offer.
	</div>

	<div  class="header"> Design Principles</div>
	<div class="post-content">
		It's always a good practice to start any design with a set of guiding principles. Well that would be great if you can actually able to set out all the principles before getting start, but not in our case. The principles emerged along the design process, with many back and fort decisions to be made that eventually we needed to align on a set of baseline principles. The principles work as a base line for all the design decision and also be a north start for any arguement. It's as simple as 3 bullet points, to remind ourselves during the design process.
		<p>
		• Intentional - Clear reason and purpose in actions to be taken</br>
		• Engaging - Sense of involvement through delightful interaction and feedback</br>
		• Seamless - Closes the loop with end-to-end frictionless flow
		</p>
	</div>

	<div  class="header"> Design Breakdown</div>
	<div class="post-content">
		We ran a few rounds of sketching, drawing and exploration to produce the low-fidelity prototype and brought it to user test. The main flow is quite straightforward but we would go diverge beyond MVP to explore the opportunity then converge again to what is really feasible within the timeline and technical constraints. 
	</div>

	<img src="/assets/images/c2c/c2c5.png" style=" width: 100%;" class="fade resize"/>

	<div class="post-content">
		We imagined how we could prompt the user in their Grab Car journey to collect a voucher that can be used when they arrive at destination. </br>
		We made it fun with graphic elements like a treasure found.</br>
		We explored ways for the user to browse and be incentivised to do so.</br>
		We considered various interface and interaction to help users make sense of the action.

			Some of the early sketches in our brainstorm session.			
	</div>

	<div class="post-content">
		When we were 80% confident with the design, we brought it to the usability test and do 3 more rounds of internal design review. Man, it was not easy to pass them all...but that's the point, isn't it?
		With every feedback and insight, we questioned our design with a new problem statement.</br>
		<p>
		• Although most users have their guess on 'why' they have to collect the voucher before using it, many of them missed the small text indicates inventory "100 left" —> HMW help customer making sense of the friction while staying true and transparent on the product? On the other hand, if we keep showing the real-time number of how much inventory left, will it still create the hype when the number says "1000 left"?
		</p>
		<p>
		• The skeuomorphic UI on the card though was intended to remind customers about the local BurgerKing's physical coupons, it received critic saying not only it was outdated style but also create too strong visual weight with excessing lines and texts in such small estate of the bottom sheet. —> HMW improving the layout to make it minimal but still maintain the key information to help the customer decide to collect the voucher?
		</p>
		• Internally we debated whether the customer has strong need to distinguish the newly collected voucher with other vouchers they have. Usability test findings suggest that customer don't necessarily differentiate which voucher is collected and which is freely given, but they do need guidance to know where they can find the offer when they need it. —> HMW help users understand where to access the collected voucher?

	<div  class="header"> Why interaction?</div>
	<div class="post-content">
		In many occasions, the product team may find doing interaction is a bit of extra effort and would prefer a simpler solution, especially with a tight timeline. On the other hand, as designers, we understand how just a tiny movement can bring a lot of meaning and so much delight to the experience. For this project, while adding friction is inevitable, we believed and have been proven right, that a bit of interaction would defeat the hassle. The behavioural term to explain this trade-off is called "Illusion of Control". 	
	</div>

	<div class="callout2"> </div>
	<div class="fade callout2text">
		<span style="font-family: avenir-medium"> Illusion of Control </span></br>
		The belief that our actions have the power to impact and change a given situation. One good example is that a lot of people still actively pushing non-stop on the traffic light buttons for pedestrians in New York even though 80% of them are not actually work right.

	<div class="post-content">
		We evaluated a few common gestures in both iOS and Android to shortlisted 2 best ones. “Hold and slide” suppose to be the best choice and we did chose it for the first design. Giving users the option to swipe and collect makes them feel more in control and involved in the process. The more he is in control, the more he remembers the experience and feels the need to take the next action. Usability wise, it fulfilled the purpose, however, that particular gesture had been used for a very different use case in Grab that we thought it would be safer to use “long press” instead. Hence, in final design we use long press.

	<div class="title">Chapter IV. The Learning</div>
	<div class="post-content">
		Wow you read through here!</br>
		Or did you just jump right here hmmmm? 🧐 
		<p>
		Whatever it is, this must be the most important part of all. This project is one of the leanest projects I have done in Grab. It took less than a quarter from scratch till release-ready product, with a team of very limit resource. With COVID-19 pandemic in the picture, everything from exploration, research, design execution till hand-over, we did it throughout without a physical meeting. It was challenging at first but with we learnt to get along with the situation eventually.
		</p>
		<p>
		• Over-communication is the key. Well, it was true that there was no *physical* meeting, but there were instead 5 times more virtual meetings than we usually have. I talked to my peer so frequently, our calendars are full of 30 minutes sync up blocks just for two persons.
		</p>
		<p>
		• The Collectable Voucher was initiated by the business team to fulfils a business purpose. There was no strong customer needs to desire for yet another type of promotion. On the contrary to the norm, instead of making the new promotion similar to others, we add a bit of friction to justify its value proposition, making it a special type of offer that requires more attention. It was with the help of the behavioural scientist Preeti that we explored the psychology to prove our design decision.
		</p>
		• Interaction is not just a cherry on top but can be crucial to define an experience delightful or hassle. Since we already added the extra step of "collection", it becomes important to make it a nice extra. Keep that understanding in mind, we spent a large portion of time to explore, create and reject so many interaction options. With each of the trial we made, it came with new learning when we tested or shared with the design peers. Although it was tiring at times, we knew it worth and hopefully these learnings will save us time in the future.	
	</div>

	<div class="title">Closing</div>
	<div class="post-content">
		I would love to tell you some number to showing off how effective the design is. Unfortunately, again, due to COVID-19, the release was postponed and scaled down hence I don't have any number to share. However, I can tell that the final product did receive positive feedback internally and I am happy with how it turns out.
