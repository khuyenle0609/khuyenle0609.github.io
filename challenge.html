    <div class="title">Background</div>
	<div class="post-content" style="margin-bottom:32px">
        In July 2019, Grab introduced "Challenges" - designed with gamification as its base concept to drive users towards becoming a loyal user by leverage their sense of challenge, competition and as a result, change their behaviour and inspire action. 

        The product was initially developed by another team in Grab but get transferred to my team 2 months after its launch. After rounds of iteration and argument, Challenge V.2 re-launch in February 2020.	
    </div>

    <div class="header">My Role</div>
	<div class="post-content">
        I was the lead Product designer in charge, responsible for analysing and setting out the new direction when my team receive Challenge product. I hosted a workshop and a few ideation sessions with other colleauges from other function, we explored many design approaches and brought it to test with real users. I also handled the internal tool for Operators to set up Challenges, which also came along with a set of Guideline document, also written by me.

	<div  class="header"> Observation</div>
	<div class="post-content">
        <p>
        • Although the product is very simple to participate, we realise that it was not as exciting as it supposed to be to our user. The opt-in rate and completion rate were not up to business expectation.
        </p>
        <p>
        • Via post-launch interview and behavioural study, we have learnt that the gamification intention was not well executed, hence the product became "too transactional”.
        </p>
        <p>
        • Teams on the ground (country operation teams), in the light of gamification, have wanted to create more complex quests such as adding checkpoints and levels to it. Unfortunately, the MVP product at the time showed a very steep downtrend in opt-in rate when it comes to level 2.

    <div  class="header"> Hypithesis and Solution</div>
	<div class="post-content">
        <p>
        • To raise opt-in rate and user engagement, we were conceiving a design revamp focus to enhance visual elements, adding more fun excitement but comprehensive and straightforward.
        </p>
        <p>
        • We identified the lack of visibility to subsequent levels is the key issue that led to low completion rate of quests with multiple levels. A design that shows all checkpoints and levels upfront, showcase the full quest journey and rewards will encourage users to opt-in and complete faster. Consequently, this will help raise the platform's Gross Merchandise Value and Average Product Holding.
        </p>
        <p>
        • By improving the way we communicate with in-app content, Challenge can be more engaging and relevant to our users.

    <div class="title" >Chapter I. The Research</div>
	<div  class="header"> Kick-Off</div>
	<div class="post-content">
        Since the product has launched for a while, instead of jumping to build the next feature from business ask, I wanted to look at the early data we have and conducted user interview to get both quantitative and qualitative insights, to identify what else is missing.

    <div class="post-content">
        → Data suggested that Challenge has not created the hype we wanted, it could be for several reasons. So Frank - our in house researcher help me review a research plan. Our goals were to understand what is the drive and barrier of user toward the product that already launched and what they really think when they consider playing the quest.
        We then flew to Jakarta to conducted the interview with 12 users.
    </div>

    <div  class="header"> Identify Problems</div>
	<div class="post-content">
        In the context of Challenge, we’ve identified 4 types of user.
        <p>
        • <b>The Gamer</b>: I join and keep up frequently for the rewards and sense of achievement.
        </p>
        <p>
        • <b>The Low Hanger</b>: I’m interested in Challenge but I forget about it after a while.
        </p>
        <p>
        • <b>The Hold Back</b>: I’m interested but if the Challenge requires too much effort I won’t join.
        </p>
        <p>
        • <b>The Go-getter</b>: I’m not keen on exploring the app, won’t join Challenge because I’m afraid I will overspend.
        </p>
        <p>
        And hear what they have to say about Grab Challenge at the time.

        <span style="color: #122C91; background-color: #FFFFEF;">
        1. Challenge is “too transactional” it makes user very rational to play.
        </span>
    </div>

    <div class="post-content">
        On the business side, it is proven by data that users who accepted quests tent to shift their spending a bit more, which is our business goal internally. 
        However, most users tend to be very calculative when they consider accepting a quest, which should not be the case if gamification was well executed. Users, especially The Low Hanger and The Hold Back, they don't see the need to order extra GrabFood or ride GrabCar more frequently for the game if the return reward was not worth their spending. It will always be a math problem between the budget they spend to accomplish the task and what they will get in return. 
    </div>

    <div class="fade callout" style="background-color: white; font-family: avenir-oblique;">
        “I only use Grab Food as much as I need. If I join, I may order more and more.” 
    </div>

    <div class="post-content">
        In the previous 2 months, the rewards we gave out for Challenge finisher are discount vouchers for Grab services (i.e Free Delivery for GrabFood order). But on a separate note, in our effort to gain user's interest, Grab and merchants who partner with Grab (says McDonald on GrabFood) already give out much promotion, which makes Challenges even less attractive. 
    </div>

    <div class="fade callout" style="background-color: white; font-family: avenir-oblique;">
        "I'm already given 10% discount for free, I want to use it. Why do I want to make 3 GrabFood orders without promotion just to get Free deliver fee voucher? Not worth it."
    </div>

        <span style="color: #122C91; background-color: #FFFFEF;">
        2. There were too little engagement and no delight in the journey it becomes insipid
        </span>
    </div>

    <div class="post-content">
        When being asked to recall the quest they have accepted before or any quests that they have passed by in the app, most users were not able to. We went further to let the user actually use their phone and try to find where they have seen Challenges but many users tapped into a wrong entry point.
        <p>
        Accepting a quest is a straightforward and uneventful event. User read through the task, look at the terms and conditions of the reward they may win, consider if it worth a try, tap "Accept Challenge" and they all done. After accepting the quest, users suppose to go back to the home screen and make food orders or book some rides - which internally we hope by having Challenge in place we encourage they do so more often. It turned out the memory about Challenge escaped their mind and we didn't have any way to encourage them to change their behaviour. 
        </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="fade callout" style="background-color: white; font-family: avenir-oblique;">
        “I was not focusing on the challenge. I still order food and use promo as usual.”
    </div>

    <div class="header" >
        <span style="color: #122C91; background-color: #FFFFEF;">
        3. An ending quest is less likely to be taken, since it seems impossible to win
        </span>
    </div>

    <div class="post-content">
        Most users would calculate the chance to win base on their own usage habit. If they discover a quest when it's about to end, it is less likely they will join because the user knows they will not be able to stretch their usage to meet the task requirement.
        <p>
        This finding explains why level 2 and 3 opt-in rate is much less than level 1. At the time, all levels must be finished in one time frame (i.e 30 days), but we only show level 2 after user finish level 1. Consequently, most users only see level 2 when it's only 4 days left.
        </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="fade resize">
		<img src="/assets/images/bravo/bravo5.png" />
    </div>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        When analysed deeper into this subject, we also found that visibility of subsequent levels is the root problem. If they were able to see the full journey of all the levels and seeing the bigger reward hanging at the end of later levels, users would be able to plan their spending and shift their usage to meet the requirement in time.

    <div class="title" >Chapter III. The Design</div>
	<div  class="header"> Ideation</div>
	<div class="post-content">
        Problem identified,  then I hosted a workshop with 20+ people who were decision-makers and all of the working team. We shared our knowledge from the insights, aligned on the objectives and direction we want Challenge to become. The important part of the workshop was a brainstorming activity to let everyone has a chance to be creative with the product they own. We had some really fun ideas. Some of the ideas inspired the design we have in the final product.

        💭 How might we encourage user to play the quest while spending less on the reward?
    </div>

    <div class="post-content">
        We knew from researches that users are intrigued by attractive rewards, which, business-wise, we can only give out once they meet a certain transaction threshold. In the other hand, we also understood a quest that requires too much stretch from a player will make him frustrated. We had to find that sweet spot of balance between business expense and user's interest.

        Celebrate Small Wins
        </span>
    </div>
    <div class="post-content">
        Instead of asking the user to invest big effort at once, we break a quest into checkpoints and celebrate the small wins. With each checkpoint reached, users can receive a small reward, likely a non-monetary one.

    <div class="post-content">
        Third-party brands can promote their product via our platform while funding for Challenge's reward. The exclusivity from the brand rewards (i.e a pair of tickets to watch Disney Frozen) makes the quest much more enticing to play while Grab can reduce our cost.

    <div class="post-content">
        User will be able to preview all level' tasks and rewards from the beginning. Subsequent milestones are more challenging but players are awarded even more alluring prizes. Expiry date, which was one of the critical concerns for the user when they consider the quest, will also be presented upfront to help them better plan their moves to complete the quest.

    <div class="post-content">
        In the revamp UI design, we makeover the whole quest details. The cover image was enlarged since this is the eye-stopper of the quest and also is critical real estate to present the quest theme. With the user's status in the quest changes over time, the page will change to show only relevant information.
        <p>
        A new component was introduced, which is called "nudge bar". The nudge bar was created with dynamic and contextual content that will change according to the user's status in the quest. We lever on the nudge bar to have a conversation with our user. The text can be used to nudge users to accept the quest, to cheer their achievement, or to summarize the status. We make sure the text is as thematic as the quest.

    <div class="post-content">
        During one of our usability test, we discovered that despite the complication of the quest mechanic, especially quests with checkpoints and multi-levels, the players simply followed the most simple instruction they can understand. People don't spend and don't want to spend too much time to guess what they need to do to get to the next reward. With the straightforward instruction on the quest card, without tapping to see the detail, the player would already know the next thing he should do to move on in the quest.

    <div class="title" >Chapter IV. The Learning</div>
	<div class="post-content">
        Although the base product is in place, revamping it is more complicated than I anticipated. It was critical for us to slow down and rethink about the product vision as much as understanding the customer problems. 
        <p>
        I learnt a lot by working collaboratively with Jun and Sabri. They pushed me further to expand creativity limit. I was playing safe, constrained myself in the old design structure, touching the problem on the surface. We kept iterating the design, testing our limit. No one would give us more time on design just by a request. We had been testing and iterating continuously, the feedback loop was our bread to buy time. Decision-makers were kept in the loop so they became a part of the making. With every round of review, both by senior managers and real customers, we went back to iteration. And with every round of iteration, the design came out even more robust. 
        The final delivery turns out a great success. It was a tough negotiation but determining in the outcome and believing in the design direction are like make-believe, it kept us going.

    <div class="title" >Closing</div>
	<div class="post-content">
        The revamp project spanned 1.5 quarter to deliver. That is what it takes to do it right. 
        <p>
        The new Challenge experience brought confidence to Grab team that we can again win the heart of our customers. As a ‘gamification’ product, it fulfils the goal to bring joy and delight while they transact on Grab.
