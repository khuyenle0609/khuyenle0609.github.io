        At Grab, we do lots of marketing campaigns every day to promote our services. Traditionally, like many of our competitors in the region, we giving out tons of discount and promotion.
        Flash Sale is a specific type of campaign in which the promotion has limited availability, both in expiry and inventory. E-commerce companies has been benefiting from Flash Sale's effectiveness to attract daily active users and activate customer’s impulsive buy. Grab is no e-commerce but more of a daily productivity app, though our objectives are similar. This project explores the adaptation of Flash Sale onto Grab app, aims to achieve the same effect.

        Marketing campaigns are costly in general, especially with ineffective campaigns where customers are flooded with promotion that just hit the wrong spot. The goal is to spend smartly and make sure our users get the most out of what we give away. In return, they engage more often with our app and end up contribute higher to our revenue.

        With Flash Sale design in Grab, we leverage on multiple psychological nudges to optimize the conversion rate. Countdown timer is used both to create anticipation to wait for the Campaign start as well as sense of urgency when the Campaign happens. The reminder function comes in handy for customer to shows their interest so that we will make sure to have them come back to the app via a reminder notification. To make sure the user won't miss out good deals, we rank the offers base on data science model that prioritize relevancy, distance and profitability. Each offer in Flash Sale is carefully curated to fit the campaign theme. Social norm and scarcity are used at specific time base on the redemption data - each has its use to urge for conversion.

        This project went through many rounds of review - iteration cycle. With each design update it comes out more promising. Long before the product team decide to make it a proper feature, operation teams  from the ground have been hacking their ways to produce different types of campaign, including Flash Sale. Learning from the way  they hack the system, this project aims to bring better experience not for just end customer but also the internal operators. 

        The design was highly praised by all country managers from all of our markets (SG, ID, TH, MY, VN, PH) during our roadshows sharing this product with them. Everyone was excited to see this coming.
